# üé§ Real-time Reflectly Transcription

This project now includes real-time microphone transcription capabilities with real-time feedback and analysis. You can capture audio from your microphone, send it to AssemblyAI for real-time transcription, and receive instant coaching feedback.

## Features
-   **Real-time Transcription**: Captures audio from your microphone and transcribes it in real-time.
-   **Speaker Diarization**: Identifies different speakers in the audio stream.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text.
-   **Real-time Feedback**: Provides instant feedback on your speaking performance.
-   **Token-based Authentication**: Uses temporary tokens for secure connection to AssemblyAI.

### Real-time Feedback Analysis
The system analyzes your speech and provides feedback on:
-   **Pacing**: Are you speaking too fast or too slow?
-   **Filler Words**: Are you using too many filler words like "um" or "uh"?
-   **Sentiment**: What is the overall sentiment of your speech?

## Demos
-   **Basic Real-time Demo**: `realtimeDemo.ts`
-   **Microphone Demo**: `realtimeMicrophone.ts` and `realtimeMicrophone.html`
-   **Real-time Feedback System**: Complete coaching platform with feedback loops
