# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in CSS Files

## Analysis of AI Agent Mistake
1. **What the AI agent did wrong:**
   - The AI agent modified the `globals.css` file without verifying correct CSS syntax, leading to a syntax error detected by the TypeScript compiler.

2. **What it should have done instead:**
   - The agent should have examined the CSS for potential issues related to the inclusion of custom at-rules (like `@theme`) and ensured all CSS properties and rules were valid before making any modifications or reporting success.

## Specific Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors

### Rule 1: Validate CSS Syntax Before Modifications
- **Description:** Ensure CSS files are syntactically correct before saving changes.
- **Implementation:** Analyze the file using a CSS linter to catch errors prior to modification.
  
### Rule 2: Use Only Standard CSS Features
- **Description:** Avoid using non-standard or experimental CSS features unless confirmed to be compatible.
- **Implementation:** Establish a standard CSS feature set and restrict modifications to those known to be stable.

### Rule 3: Test Changes in a Safe Environment
- **Description:** Implement a staging environment to test CSS changes before deploying them to production.
- **Implementation:** Include a validation step to review changes in a local or testing environment.

### Rule 4: Provide Detailed Error Feedback
- **Description:** When a syntax error is detected, provide detailed feedback on the error location and nature.
- **Implementation:** Log error details and suggestions for correction when modifications fail.

## Code Examples

### Incorrect Approach
```css
@theme inline { /* This custom at-rule may not be valid */
  --color-background: var(--background);
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
  --font-sans: var(--font-geist-sans);
  --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);
}
```
### Correct Approach
```css
/* Use standard CSS variables for theming without an unsupported at-rule */
:root {
  --color-background: var(--background);
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
}

/* Media query for dark theme */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background: #0a0a0a;
    --foreground: #ededed;
  }
}
```

## Summary
By following these cursor rules, the AI agent can avoid syntax errors in CSS files and ensure that modifications are valid and accepted by the TypeScript compiler.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Modification Errors

## 1. Error Analysis
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent made a direct modification to the `README-VIBEHACK.md` file without verifying the correctness of the content or following a structured process. This led to a syntax error detected by the TypeScript compiler.

### What the AI Should Have Done Instead
The AI agent should have performed a validation check on its suggestions before making modifications. This includes ensuring that any code provided is syntactically correct and adheres to the project's standards.

## 2. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern
The following cursor rules can be added to the `.cursorrules` file to avoid the aforementioned issue:

### Rule 1: Validate Code Syntax Before Modification
- **Rule**: Always validate any code snippets that are part of suggestions before making modifications.
- **Purpose**: To ensure that no syntax errors are introduced into the codebase.

### Rule 2: Require Confirmation for Modifications
- **Rule**: Require user confirmation for any modification that alters files directly, especially documentation files.
- **Purpose**: To create a double-check mechanism that reduces errors made by the AI agent.

### Rule 3: Document Code Change Context
- **Rule**: Provide a clear context of code changes in the response, specifying what was changed and why.
- **Purpose**: To ensure transparency in modifications made by the AI agent.

### Rule 4: Use Pre-Defined Template for Descriptions
- **Rule**: Any new code added must follow a predefined template for descriptions and instructions to avoid ambiguity.
- **Purpose**: To ensure clarity and uniformity in documentation.

## 3. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach
```markdown
# Incorrect Modification Example
Agent modified README-VIBEHACK.md
CODE PROVIDED:
function exampleFunction() {
    console.log('Hello, world! // Missing closing quote
}
```

### Correct Approach
```markdown
# Correct Modification Example
### Suggested Modifications for README-VIBEHACK.md

- **Change Description**: Added a new function example that demonstrates a simple log message.
  
#### Code Validated and Correct:
```typescript
function exampleFunction() {
    console.log('Hello, world!'); // Now has the correct syntax
}
```
- **Action Required**: User confirmation before applying this change.
```

By instituting these rules, we can significantly reduce the risk of errors arising from failed suggestions and foster a more reliable AI modification process.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in AI Modifications

## Issue Overview
The AI agent suggested a file modification that resulted in a syntax error in the README file. Specifically, the agent made changes without adequate validation or checks leading to TypeScript syntax issues.

### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
1. The agent modified the README file without performing sufficient syntax validation.
2. It failed to ensure that the changes made were valid TypeScript code, leading to compilation errors.
3. The response did not clarify the nature of the changes and left ambiguity about correctness.

### What the AI Agent Should Have Done Instead
1. Validate changes against a linter or compiler before suggesting file modifications.
2. Provide clear documentation of changes made, specifying that they are intended to adhere to a certain coding standard.
3. Interface with TypeScript tooling to ensure no syntax errors are introduced in the code.

## Specific Cursor Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Modifications
#### Description
Before any file modification is suggested, run a syntax validation check against the modified file.

```plaintext
* Ensure that all code changes are validated using a TypeScript linter or compiler before suggesting modifications.
* Use a predefined syntax validation function to encapsulate this check.
```

### Rule 2: Provide Clear Documentation of Changes
#### Description
When suggesting modifications, include a comment explaining the purpose and expected correctness of the changes.

```plaintext
* Add comments to the code with an explanation of what the modification does, including any relevant examples.
* For example, a proper comment might look like this:
  
  // Integrating vibeHack monitoring into Live Coach: 
  // This change ensures real-time code quality checks without syntax issues.
```

### Rule 3: Interface with TypeScript Tooling
#### Description
Develop a protocol to interact with TypeScript tools for real-time error checking before suggesting code changes.

```plaintext
* Use TypeScript's API or other tools like ESLint to pre-check syntax and provide validation feedback.
* The modification check should return a success status before finalizing any code changes.
```

## Code Examples of Incorrect vs Correct Approaches

### Incorrect Approach

This approach did not validate or document changes, leading to errors.

```typescript
// Incorrect modification
// This change leads to a syntax error
const vibeHack = "vibeHack Integration"; // Missing closing brackets

// No validation performed
```

### Correct Approach

The following approach validates modifications and documents them effectively.

```typescript
// Correct modification
// Integrating vibeHack AI into Live Coach
const vibeHack = "vibeHack Integration";  // Valid string assignment

// Before this modification, run a TypeScript validation check:
// Ensure `const` type is correctly used, and syntax is correct
// Validation check successful
```

## Summary
By implementing these cursor rules, the AI agent should avoid introducing syntax errors when suggesting modifications. Prioritizing validation, clear documentation, and integration with TypeScript tooling will enhance code reliability and reduce compilation issues.

```markdown
# Cursor Rules for Preventing Syntax Errors in File Modifications

## 1. What the AI agent did wrong
The AI agent attempted to modify the `smartTranscribe.ts` file without properly validating the TypeScript code syntax. The modification led to a syntax error being flagged by the TypeScript compiler.

## 2. What it should have done instead
The AI agent should have validated the TypeScript code for syntax errors before making modifications to the file. This includes using a linter or compiler to check for syntax correctness after any changes.

## 3. Specific rules to prevent this pattern

### Rule 1: Syntax Validation Before Modification
- **Description:** Always check for syntax errors using TypeScript compiler or linter before making any modifications to a TypeScript file.
- **Implementation:**
  - Run `tsc -noEmit` on the modified file prior to the change, and check if the command returns any errors.

### Rule 2: Comprehensive Testing of Code Changes
- **Description:** After modifications are made, automatically run a set of tests to verify that the code behaves as expected before considering the change finalized.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use Jest or Mocha to run tests on the modified code, ensuring no breaking changes were introduced.

### Rule 3: Establish a Minimum Context Check
- **Description:** Ensure that any changes consider the entire context (functions, variables) of the file to prevent incomplete code snippets resulting in syntax errors.
- **Implementation:**
  - Analyze surrounding lines of code when making modifications to ensure completeness and correctness.

### Rule 4: Leverage Auto-formatter Tools
- **Description:** Utilize auto-formatting tools like Prettier to format the code after modifications but before committing changes.
- **Implementation:**
  - Run `prettier --check smartTranscribe.ts` on the modified file.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
// AI attempts to modify code without syntax checks
const apiKey = process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY!;
async function smartTranscribe(inputFilePath?: string, speakers: number = 2) {
  // Omitted content leading to an incomplete function 
  ...
}
// Resulted in Syntax Error: Incomplete function or variable definition
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
// Run TypeScript checks before modifications
const apiKey = process.env.ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY!;
async function smartTranscribe(inputFilePath?: string, speakers: number = 2) {
  // Complete the function to ensure it doesn't result in a syntax error
  let filePath: string;
  if (inputFilePath) {
    filePath = inputFilePath;
  } else {
    // Handle the default case or throw an error
    filePath = 'default/path/to/file';
  }
}
// After modifications, run validation commands
// 1. tsc -noEmit
// 2. jest or mocha test cases
// 3. prettier --check
```

With these rules in place, the likelihood of introducing syntax errors during automated file modifications will be significantly diminished.
```

# Original Query: File modification: server.js...
# Error: Syntax error detected by TypeScript compiler...

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Mistakes in Code Modifications

## Analysis of the Error
1. **What the AI agent did wrong**: 
   - The AI agent incorrectly modified the `server.js` file, likely introducing a syntax error that was not present before. The specific error was a missing closing brace or semicolon, leading to a `SyntaxError`.

2. **What it should have done instead**:
   - The AI agent should have verified the integrity and syntax of the code before applying any modifications. This includes checking for common syntax issues, ensuring that errors are flagged before changes are made, and applying changes only when the existing code is valid.

## Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

```plaintext
# Rule 1: Verify Syntax Before Modification
- Before the agent applies any changes to the code, it must parse the file and ensure that there are no syntax errors present. Only if the syntax is valid should any modifications be attempted.

# Rule 2: Use Linting Tools
- Integrate a linting tool (like ESLint) that runs on the codebase before modifications. The agent should only proceed if the linting passes without errors.

# Rule 3: Backup Original Code
- Before making any modifications to a file, the agent should create a backup copy of the original code. If a syntax error occurs post-modification, the code can be reverted to the backup.

# Rule 4: Provide Detailed Error Reporting
- If a syntax error occurs after modification, the agent should provide detailed reports about the specific nature of the error, including the line number and a description of the error.

# Rule 5: Require User Confirmation for Modifications
- Implement a confirmation prompt to require user validation before applying any changes to files. The user can review the modifications and ensure that syntax correctness is maintained.
```

## Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

```javascript
// INCORRECT APPROACH: Modification without syntax validation
// Missing closing brace for JSON response
app.post('/api/realtime-token', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { apiKey } = req.body;
        
        if (!apiKey) {
            return res.status(400).json({ error: "No API key provided" // Syntax error
        }
        // Further processing...
    } catch (err) {
        // Handle error
    }
});

// CORRECT APPROACH: Validate syntax before modifying
app.post('/api/realtime-token', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { apiKey } = req.body;
        
        if (!apiKey) {
            return res.status(400).json({ error: "No API key provided" }); // Correct syntax
        }
        // Further processing...
    } catch (err) {
        // Handle error
    }
});
``` 

By implementing the above cursor rules, we can guide the AI agent to avoid introducing syntax errors, ensure proper code validation before modification, and create a safer coding environment.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Mistakes

## 1. Identify the Mistake
### What the AI agent did wrong:
- The AI agent executed a modification to the `README.md` file without verifying the correctness of the change.
- The change introduced a syntax error that triggered a TypeScript compiler error.

## 2. What it should have done instead:
- The AI agent should have:
  - Validated the content of the `README.md` file against common markdown standards or specific project formats before modifying it.
  - Implemented a check to ensure that changes do not conflict with existing code or project structure to maintain integrity of the project documentation.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent this Pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Markdown Syntax
- **Description**: Ensure that any modifications to markdown files are validated for markdown syntax correctness.
- **Implementation**:
  - Before applying changes to a `.md` file, run a markdown linting tool or parser to check for basic syntax correctness.
  
### Rule 2: Contextual Change Assessment
- **Description**: Assess context before making modifications to project files.
- **Implementation**:
  - Analyze the contents of the file and ensure that changes do not interfere with code or accompanying documentation style.
  - Verify that the modifications are logically consistent with the surrounding content.

### Rule 3: Use Temporary Staging for Changes
- **Description**: Implement a staging area for modifications before applying them directly.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a temporary file or snapshot that applies the modifications. Verify the correctness and then apply changes to the original file only if validated successfully.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach (original AI action):
```markdown
# Incorrect README.md Modification Example
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://locahost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. # Typo introduced here!
```

### Correct Approach (with validation):
```markdown
# Correct README.md Modification Example
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. # No syntax errors
```

```markdown
# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in CSS Modification by AI Agents

## Rule 1: Prevent Direct File Modifications Without Validation
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The agent directly modified the `globals.css` file without validation, leading to a syntax error detected by the TypeScript compiler.
- **What it should have done instead:** The agent should first validate the CSS for syntax correctness before attempting to modify the file.

### Specific Rule:
```plaintext
# Cursor Rule: Validate syntax before file modification
if (fileType == "css") {
    validateSyntax(fileContent) -> proceedToModify(fileContent);
} else {
    promptUser("Unsupported file type for modification.");
}
```

---

## Rule 2: Check for Existing Syntax Errors
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The AI failed to check for existing syntax errors before making modifications.
- **What it should have done instead:** Check for existing syntax errors in the CSS before making any changes.

### Specific Rule:
```plaintext
# Cursor Rule: Check existing syntax errors
if (checkForSyntaxErrors(fileContent)) {
    promptUser("Please resolve syntax errors before modification.");
} else {
    proceedToModify(fileContent);
}
```

---

## Rule 3: Ensure Proper Structure of CSS at Specific Points
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The modification introduced a syntax error due to improper rules or missing semicolons/structures in CSS.
- **What it should have done instead:** Ensure CSS follows a proper structure, e.g., every property must end with a semicolon.

### Specific Rule:
```plaintext
# Cursor Rule: Enforce proper CSS structure
if (fileType == "css") {
    for each (line in fileContent) {
        if (line.endsWith("{") && !line.contains("}")) {
            promptUser("Ensure all { have matching }.");
        }
        if (!line.endsWith(";") && !line.isComment()) {
            promptUser("Ensure every CSS property ends with a semicolon.");
        }
    }
    proceedToModify(fileContent);
}
```

---

## Rule 4: Incorporate Syntax Linter Usage
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The AI agent didn't make use of any CSS linter tools to prevent issues.
- **What it should have done instead:** Utilize a CSS linter to catch any possible syntax errors before or after modifications.

### Specific Rule:
```plaintext
# Cursor Rule: Utilize CSS linter
if (fileType == "css") {
    linterResults = runCSSTool(fileContent);
    if (linterResults.hasErrors()) {
        promptUser("Linter detected errors. Please fix before modifying.");
    } else {
        proceedToModify(fileContent);
    }
}
```

---

## Example of Incorrect vs Correct Approach

### Incorrect Approach (AI Agent’s Original Code):
```css
@theme inline {  /* Incorrect CSS syntax */
  --color-background: var(--background)
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
}
```

### Correct Approach:
```css
@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--background); /* Notice the semicolon added */
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
}
```
``` 

This structured markdown format establishes clear rules for cursor behavior, helping prevent syntax errors during CSS modifications by AI agents.

# Original Query: File modification: smartTranscribe.ts...
# Error: Syntax error detected by TypeScript compiler...

```markdown
# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in AI Agent Code Modifications

## Rule 1: Avoid Automatic Modifications Without Context Verification
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The agent modified the file `smartTranscribe.ts` without validating the entire syntax of the file, leading to a syntax error in TypeScript.
- **What it should have done instead:** The agent should have analyzed the complete context of the code to ensure there were no syntax errors or incomplete structures before making any changes.

### Correct Approach
- Implement a validation step to analyze the code before making modifications.
- Example:
    ```typescript
    // Pseudocode for checking syntax
    function validateCode(inputCode: string): boolean {
        try {
            new Function(inputCode);
            return true; // No syntax errors
        } catch (error) {
            return false; // Syntax errors present
        }
    }

    if (validateCode(fileContent)) {
        // Proceed with modifications
    } else {
        // Log error and do not modify
    }
    ```

## Rule 2: Complete Code Blocks Must Be Presented for Modifications
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The agent provided an incomplete function implementation which resulted in a syntax error.
- **What it should have done instead:** Ensure the full function or code block is provided, allowing for adequate context and avoiding incomplete code segments.

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
async function smartTranscribe(inputFilePath?: string, speakers: number = 2) {
  // Code is incomplete
  let filePath: string;
  
  if (inputFilePath) {
    filePath = inputFilePath;
  } else...
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
async function smartTranscribe(inputFilePath?: string, speakers: number = 2) {
  // Complete implementation
  let filePath: string;
  
  if (inputFilePath) {
    filePath = inputFilePath;
  } else {
    // Provide a fallback or throw an error
    throw new Error("Input file path is required.");
  }
  
  // Additional logic goes here...
}
```

## Rule 3: Proper Error Handling and User Feedback
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The agent did not account for possible input errors, which could lead to misinterpretations and faulty code changes.
- **What it should have done instead:** Incorporate error handling to provide feedback when the code changes aren't viable.

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
// No error handling in the function
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
async function smartTranscribe(inputFilePath?: string, speakers: number = 2) {
    try {
        // existing logic...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("An error occurred in smartTranscribe:", error);
        throw new Error("Failed to complete transcription process.");
    }
}
```

## Rule 4: Review the Syntax and Formatting Style
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The response included syntax that didn't meet TypeScript's requirements, such as the incomplete control structure.
- **What it should have done instead:** Before suggesting code modifications, apply a linter or formatter to ensure compliance with TypeScript guidelines.

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
// Original code contains syntax issues.
// Some of the control structures are incomplete.
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
// Utilize a linter/formatter (like TSLint or Prettier for TypeScript) to check code.
```

## Conclusion
Adhering to these specific cursor rules will mitigate the chances of syntax errors resulting from AI agent interventions. By validating syntax, ensuring complete code blocks, implementing error handling, and maintaining consistent formatting, the quality and reliability of the AI agent's code modifications will significantly improve.

```markdown
# Cursor Rules to Prevent Failed AI Agent Suggestions

## Issue Overview
The AI agent in this scenario made an unverified modification to the `README-VIBEHACK.md` file, resulting in a syntax error detected by the TypeScript compiler. The agent failed to validate the modification against existing syntax rules and context.

## What the AI Agent Did Wrong
1. The AI agent made changes to the file without ensuring that the modifications are syntactically correct.
2. The agent did not validate the context or purpose of the file before making changes, which led to irrelevant or erroneous content being introduced.

## What the AI Agent Should Have Done Instead
1. **Validation**: Before applying any modifications, the AI agent should check for potential syntax errors or logical issues in the code.
2. **Context Awareness**: The AI should ensure any suggested changes align with the purpose and conventions of the file being modified.

## Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Syntax Validation Before Modifications
```markdown
- **Rule**: Always validate the syntax of any code or text modification before applying changes.
- **Action**: Utilize a linter or syntax parser to check for issues.
- **Example**:
  - **Incorrect (Failed Validation)**:
    ```markdown
    const example = function() { // Missing closing bracket
      console.log('Hello, World!'
    }
    ```
  - **Correct (Passed Validation)**:
    ```markdown
    const example = function() { 
      console.log('Hello, World!');
    } // Valid syntax
    ```
```

### Rule 2: Contextual Awareness Check
```markdown
- **Rule**: Ensure modifications are relevant to the specific file's purpose and content.
- **Action**: Analyze the content structure and intended usage of the file before suggesting changes.
- **Example**:
  - **Incorrect (Context Ignored)**:
    ```markdown
    // Documenting an unrelated feature not present in README
    const unrelatedFeature = () => { /* irrelevant code */ }
    ```
  - **Correct (Context Aligned)**:
    ```markdown
    // Appropriate documentation related to vibeHack usage in Live Coach
    ## How to integrate vibeHack with Live Coach
    ```
```

### Rule 3: Change Proposal Review Process
```markdown
- **Rule**: Implement a review process for changes proposed by the AI agent.
- **Action**: Require approval from a human reviewer before finalizing modifications.
- **Example**:
  - **Workflow**: AI suggests changes → Human reviews and validates → Approved changes are applied.
```

### Rule 4: Use of Version Control for Rollback
```markdown
- **Rule**: Utilize version control for all modifications made by the AI agent.
- **Action**: Allow easy rollback to previous states when syntactical or contextual issues are detected post-modification.
- **Example**:
  - **Setup**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Backup before AI modifications"
    ```
  - **Rollback**: 
    ```bash
    git checkout HEAD~1 // Revert to previous version
    ```
```

By incorporating these rules into the .cursorrules file, we can significantly enhance the correctness and relevance of modifications made by AI agents, thereby reducing errors and improving overall code quality.

```markdown
# Cursor Rules to Prevent Truncated Code Errors in AI Agents

## 1. AI Agent Mistake
The AI agent incorrectly modified the file `transcription.ts` by providing an incomplete code segment, resulting in a `SyntaxError`. The response was cut off mid-sentence, leading to potentially malformed or unexecutable code. 

## 2. Correct Approach
Instead of making an incomplete modification, the AI agent should provide a complete and accurately formatted code segment that includes all necessary elements. If it encounters difficulties in generating code, it should notify the user instead of proceeding with a partial update.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

- **Rule 1**: Verify completeness of code sections before presenting modifications.
    - Check if the entire structure of the code is represented properly, particularly focusing on multi-line structures (like functions, classes, or interfaces).
  
- **Rule 2**: Conduct integrity checks for the entire code snippet.
   - Ensure that the snippet does not end unexpectedly and that it adheres to standard syntax rules based on the programming language used.

- **Rule 3**: Provide clear error messages when complete code cannot be generated.
   - If a section cannot be completed, inform the user with a message like "The requested modification could not be completed due to incomplete information."

- **Rule 4**: Implement version control compatibility.
    - Before making any changes, check historical file versions to ensure that modifications are feasible without introducing errors.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in AI Agent Responses

## Rule 1: Avoid Implicit Modifications
**What the AI agent did wrong:**  
The agent directly modified the README.md file without validating the content, leading to a syntax error.

**What it should have done instead:**  
The agent should analyze the content for syntax correctness and provide suggestions before making actual modifications.

### Prevention Rule:
- **Check Code Integrity Before Modifications**
  - Ensure that any code snippets or programming instructions contain valid syntax and are error-free before committing changes.

## Rule 2: Validate File Types Before Editing
**What the AI agent did wrong:**  
The agent did not check if the required modifications were applicable to a markdown file, which typically doesn’t contain executable code.

**What it should have done instead:**  
Recognize that README.md is a markdown file and ensure only markdown-appropriate changes are made.

### Prevention Rule:
- **File Type Context Validation**
  - Identify the file type and validate whether the provided content is suitable for that type before making changes. For example, markdown files should not include executable JavaScript or TypeScript code snippets directly.

## Rule 3: Provide Clear Modifications and Context
**What the AI agent did wrong:**  
The agent failed to provide context for the modification and why the change was made.

**What it should have done instead:**  
Offer a brief explanation of the changes being suggested or made.

### Prevention Rule:
- **Include Context in Modifications**
  - Whenever a change is suggested or applied, provide a brief summary of what is being changed and the reason for the change.

## Example Code Approaches

### Correct Approach:
```
# Example Suggestion: Add Markdown Instructions

## Getting Started

To run this project, please follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And your application should be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

*Note: All provided snippets should be validated for syntax correctness before insertion.*
```

### Incorrect Approach:
```markdown
Agent modified README.md
```bash
npm install next
# should only execute in terminal, not in README.md directly
```
```

With these rules, the AI agent will be less likely to introduce syntax errors and will improve the quality of its modifications. Please ensure to regularly review and adapt the cursor rules as needed.
```

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Incomplete Code Modifications

## Rule 1: Ensure Complete Code Syntax
**What the AI agent did wrong:**
The AI modified the `realtimeMicrophoneNode.ts` file but ended with incomplete code, resulting in a `SyntaxError`.

**What it should have done instead:**
The AI should check for code completeness before making modifications and ensure all syntax elements (e.g., brackets, tags) are closed properly.

**Cursor Rule:**
- Always validate that the code structure is complete before submitting any changes to prevent partial or incomplete code patterns.

## Example of Incorrect vs Correct Approach
### Incorrect Code (Generated by Agent)
```typescript
// Incomplete class definition
class RealtimeMicrophoneTransc{
    // Missing closing brackets
```

### Correct Code (Validation Passed)
```typescript
class RealtimeMicrophoneTransc {
    // Complete class definition and implementations go here
}
```

---

## Rule 2: Perform Syntax Checking on Code
**What the AI agent did wrong:**
The agent modified the code without an explicit check for syntax errors caused by unclosed elements.

**What it should have done instead:**
Prior to modifications, the agent should run a parser or linter to catch syntax issues.

**Cursor Rule:**
- Implement a pre-modification check to run a linter or parser on the target file to ensure no syntax issues exist before making changes.

## Example of Incorrect vs Correct Approach
### Incorrect Code (No Syntax Check)
```typescript
// Modifying code without any pre-check
const someFunction = () => {
    if (true { // Missing closing parenthesis
```

### Correct Code (With Syntax Check)
```typescript
const someFunction = () => {
    if (true) { // Closing parenthesis included
        // Function logic here
    }
}
```

---

## Rule 3: Maintain Context Awareness
**What the AI agent did wrong:**
The agent ignored the context of modifications, leading to incomplete code.

**What it should have done instead:**
Take into account the current context and only make changes that are safe while preserving the integrity of the file.

**Cursor Rule:**
- Analyze the entire code context before making modifications to ensure changes do not lead to partial or broken code structures.

## Example of Incorrect vs Correct Approach
### Incorrect Code (Ignoring Context)
```typescript
// Changes without understanding the complete context
const processAudio = mic({ rate: '16000', channels: '1', debug: true }); // Conflicts in settings
```

### Correct Code (With Context Awareness)
```typescript
const processAudio = mic({
    rate: '16000',
    channels: '1',
    debug: true,
    device: 'default' // Clearly specified, knowing the context
});
```
```

# Original Query: File modification: route.ts...
# Error: FAIL: Incomplete code...

```markdown
# Cursor Rules to Prevent Incomplete Code Modifications

## 1. Identify Mistakes by the AI Agent
- **What the AI agent did wrong:**
  The agent modified the file `route.ts` but provided incomplete code, resulting in a `SyntaxError`. The code snippet shared did not include the complete function logic or the necessary return statement, which is crucial for proper execution.

## 2. What the AI Should Have Done Instead
- **What the AI should have done:**
  The agent should have ensured that any modifications to the file were complete and syntactically correct before suggesting changes. It should also have returned the full function implementation or at least checked for code completion.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Code Completion Check
- **Description:** Verify that any code modification contains complete function implementations and all required statements.
- **Implementation:** Before returning code changes, perform a completeness test on the code structure and ensuring all necessary elements (like return statements and closing brackets) are present.
  
### Rule 2: Syntax Validation
- **Description:** Validate the syntax of the code modification to prevent compilation errors.
- **Implementation:** Use a linter or parser to analyze the suggested code for syntax errors and enforce error-free code submission.

### Rule 3: Incomplete Code Warning
- **Description:** When an agent detects that the provided code is incomplete, trigger a warning and reject the modification.
- **Implementation:** Set a threshold for the length of code segments to escalate reviews when the content appears too short or specific keywords are missing.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs. Incorrect Approaches

### Correct Approach Example
```javascript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase';
import { uploadAudioFile, createTranscription } from '@/lib/transcription';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const audioFile = formData.get('audio') as File;
    const speakers = parseInt(formData.get('speakers') as string) || 2;
    
    if (!audioFile) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'No audio file provided' });
    }

    // Additional logic to upload and transcribe the audio
    // Placeholder for actual implementation
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
```

### Incorrect Approach Example
```javascript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase';
import { uploadAudioFile, createTranscription } from '@/lib/transcription';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const audioFile = formData.get('audio') as File;
    const speakers = parseInt(formData.get('speakers') as string) || 2;

    if (!audioFile) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'No audio file provided'...
      // Incomplete next steps and no closure for the try-catch block
```

These rules can be integrated into the `.cursorrules` file to enhance the AI agent's capacity to provide valid and complete code modifications, reducing the risk of syntax errors or incomplete logic in the response.
```

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Incomplete Code Modifications

## 1. What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent suggested incomplete code that led to a syntax error. It failed to complete the `initializeAIMonitoring` method, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the `TranscriptionWithAIMonitoring` class.

## 2. What It Should Have Done Instead
The AI should have either provided a complete implementation of the `initializeAIMonitoring` method or acknowledged the requirement for it. This would involve ensuring that all methods are fully defined before presenting modifications to the user.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Complete Code Verification
- **Description**: Before suggesting any code modifications, the AI should ensure that the entire code block is complete without syntax errors or incomplete structures.
- **Implementation**: Check for any incomplete functions or classes before proposing changes.
  
### Rule 2: Provide Contextual Completion
- **Description**: If a code block is incomplete, the AI should either complete it with appropriate placeholders or point out the incompleteness clearly to the user.
- **Implementation**: Utilize comments or prompts to indicate where additional code is needed, without modifying incomplete segments directly.

### Rule 3: Syntax Validation
- **Description**: Implement a syntax validation check to ensure that suggested code does not lead to common syntax errors.
- **Implementation**: Use a code linter or parser to validate proposed changes before responding to the user.

### Rule 4: User Confirmation on Modifications
- **Description**: Seek user confirmation when suggesting substantial changes, especially regarding important methods or classes.
- **Implementation**: Present the modified code with a note about potential concerns regarding completeness or correctness, asking for user acknowledgment before finalizing the change.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    const ...
    // Incomplete code, leading to a syntax error
}
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    // Implement initialization logic for AI monitoring
    this.aiMonitor = new AIMonitorIntegration();
    // Additional setup may be needed here...
    console.log('AI Monitoring initialized successfully.');
}
```

---

These rules should be added to the `.cursorrules` file to guide the AI in making complete, validated, and contextually appropriate code modifications.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Missteps in Code Modification

## 1. Problem Identification
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent modified the `transcriptionWithAI.ts` file and provided code that contained a syntax error. This indicates that the AI did not correctly validate or check the code before presenting it.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
The AI should have verified the integrity and validity of the code by running a syntax check or conducting a dry-run validation prior to suggesting modifications. Furthermore, it should have provided a summary of the changes it planned to make along with rationale.

---

## 2. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Code Syntax Before Modification
- **Description**: Ensure that any code modification suggested by the AI is preceded by a syntax validation check.
- **Implementation**: Use tools such as TypeScript’s built-in compiler for validation.

### Rule 2: Present Summary of Changes
- **Description**: The AI agent should provide a brief summary of the changes it intends to make, along with potential impacts.
- **Implementation**: Append a markdown comment summarizing changes before the code block.

### Rule 3: Include Test Case Recommendations
- **Description**: Recommend unit tests or checks post-modification to ensure functionality remains intact.
- **Implementation**: Suggest typical test scenarios based on the changes made.

---

## 3. Code Examples

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
import { AIMonitorIntegration } from './aiMonitor';
import fs from 'fs';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

export class TranscriptionWithAIMonitoring {
  private aiMonitor: AIMonitorIntegration | null = null;

  constructor() {
    this.initializeAIMonitoring();
  }

  private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    const ...
    // Missing body and causing syntax errors
  }
}
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
import { AIMonitorIntegration } from './aiMonitor';
import fs from 'fs';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

/**
 * Summary of changes made to enhance transcription workflow 
 * by integrating AI monitoring features. Ensure to validate syntax
 * and run tests after modifications.
 */

export class TranscriptionWithAIMonitoring {
  private aiMonitor: AIMonitorIntegration | null = null;

  constructor() {
    this.initializeAIMonitoring();
  }

  private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    try {
        // Implement proper initialization logic here
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error initializing AI monitoring:", error);
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Conclusion
By adhering to these rules, AI agents can minimize the chances of delivering incorrect code modifications and enhance the reliability of their suggestions. The goal is to improve both code quality and the user experience.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Incomplete Code Modifications

## Rule 1: Validate Code Completeness Before Modification
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent modified the file without ensuring that the code was complete and syntactically correct, resulting in a SyntaxError due to missing closing brackets and incomplete definitions.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
The agent should have performed syntax checking on the original code before making any modifications. If the code is incomplete, it should not make any changes and should alert the user to the issues instead.

### Preventive Rule
- **Check for Syntax Errors**: Before applying any modifications to a code file, the agent must validate the completeness and correctness of the existing code. If errors are found, the modification should be aborted.

```javascript
if (!isCodeComplete(originalCode)) {
    return 'Modification aborted due to incomplete code.';
}
```

---

## Rule 2: Maintain Code Context Awareness
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent modified the file without aware of the context in which the modifications were made, leading to a failure in maintaining valid code structures like classes and functions.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
The agent should have ensured that any modifications adhere to the overall structure of the file. It can achieve this by analyzing the context and making sure it does not leave incomplete constructs.

### Preventive Rule
- **Contextual Awareness**: Before modifying code, the agent should analyze the syntax tree or context and ensure that any changes made do not disrupt the structural integrity of the codebase.

```typescript
function isStructuralChangeValid(modification) {
    // Logic to check if modification maintains structure
}
```

---

## Rule 3: Logging Modifications with Context
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent did not clearly indicate which modifications were made or provide any context for the modifications it attempted, making it difficult to trace the source of errors.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
The agent should provide detailed logging that includes context around the changes it is making, including what has been altered, and ensure that a rollback option is available in case of failure.

### Preventive Rule
- **Detailed Change Logs**: Implement a logging mechanism that records all modifications along with context prior to applying them, to allow for easy identification of errors.

```javascript
function logModification(file, changes) {
    console.log(`Modifying ${file}: `, changes);
}
```

---

## Rule 4: Automated Testing for Code Validity
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent directly modified the code without running any automated tests or checks that could catch incomplete or malformed code.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
The agent should implement automated tests that check for syntax errors and ensure code validity after every modification. This includes running a linter or parser.

### Preventive Rule
- **Run Syntax Tests**: After any attempted changes, the agent should automatically run a syntax checker or linter to validate the integrity of the modified code.

```javascript
function runSyntaxCheck(code) {
    // Syntax checking logic
    return !hasSyntaxErrors(code);
}
```
```

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Mistakes

## 1. Issue with the AI Agent's Response
The AI agent incorrectly modified the README file and provided incomplete code, resulting in a `SyntaxError` due to truncated lines. This indicates a failure to validate code completeness before suggesting modifications.

## 2. What the AI Agent Should Have Done
Before making any modifications to a file, the AI agent should:
- Validate that the code is complete and logically correct.
- Ensure the changes made do not lead to syntax or runtime errors.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Code Completeness
- **Description:** Ensure that any code changes are complete and syntactically correct before suggesting modifications.
- **Implementation Example:** 
    - Check for closing brackets `}` and parentheses `)` in code snippets.
    - Use syntax validation tools to assess code blocks.

### Rule 2: Review Change Context
- **Description:** Ensure that the context in which the code modification is suggested is thoroughly understood, including existing code context.
- **Implementation Example:** 
    - Analyze surrounding code to maintain consistency.
    - Confirm that related imports and dependencies are in place.

### Rule 3: Provide Full Code Blocks
- **Description:** Always provide complete code snippets in the response.
- **Implementation Example:** 
    - Avoid truncating code when generating suggestions.
    - Ensure examples are self-contained and executable.

### Rule 4: Include Error Handling in Code Examples
- **Description:** When suggesting code modifications, always include error handling to prevent runtime errors.
- **Implementation Example:** 
    - Wrap async calls in try-catch blocks.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach (Agent's Response)
```typescript
export async function getRealtimeToken(apiKey: string): Promise<string> {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/token",...
  // Incomplete code leads to SyntaxError
}
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
export async function getRealtimeToken(apiKey: string): Promise<string> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/token", {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': apiKey,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      // Additional options if necessary
    });
  
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.token;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch token:', error);
    throw error; // Re-throw the error for further handling
  }
}
```

# Original Query: File modification: audio-uploader.tsx...
# Error: Syntax error detected by TypeScript compiler...

```markdown
# Cursor Rules for AI Agent

## 1. What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent directly modified the file `audio-uploader.tsx` without verifying the correctness of the changes, leading to a syntax error that was detected by the TypeScript compiler. This action breaks the functionality and integrity of the codebase.

## 2. What It Should Have Done Instead
The AI agent should have:
- **Provided a revision suggestion** rather than executing direct changes.
- **Conducted a syntax check or validation** prior to applying modifications to ensure that the proposed changes are correct and will not produce errors.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Suggest Rather than Modify
- **Action**: The AI agent should offer suggestions for modifications rather than applying them directly.
- **Example**: Rather than: `Agent modified audio-uploader.tsx`, it should state: `Agent suggests modifications to audio-uploader.tsx:`

### Rule 2: Validate Code Syntax
- **Action**: The AI agent must validate the code syntax of suggested changes before presenting them to the user or applying them.
- **Example**: Implement a pre-check for errors like this:
  ```javascript
  const code = `...`; // Code to be modified
  if (!isValidSyntax(code)) {
      return "Error: Suggested changes would result in a syntax error.";
  }
  ```

### Rule 3: Provide Detailed Error Context
- **Action**: If syntax errors or other issues arise, the AI should return detailed context about the nature of the error.
- **Example**: Instead of ambigous messages, the agent could respond with:
  ```
  Error detected: 
  Type: SyntaxError 
  File: /path/to/file 
  Details: Missing semi-colon
  ```

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
// Direct modification (causes error)
Agent modified audio-uploader.tsx

const audioUploader = () => {
    const [state, setState] = useState(;
    // This will trigger SyntaxError
}
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
// Suggested modification (no direct change)
Agent suggests modifications to audio-uploader.tsx

const audioUploader = () => {
    const [state, setState] = useState(null); // Corrected syntax
    // No error to trigger
}
```

### Error Handling Example
```typescript
// Error handled before modification
function validateAndSuggest(code: string) {
    if (!isValidSyntax(code)) {
        return "Suggestion cannot be applied due to syntax errors.";
    }
    return "Suggested changes are valid. Apply them?"; 
}

// Example call
console.log(validateAndSuggest(`const [state, setState] = useState();`));
```
```
By implementing these rules, we can significantly reduce the chance of syntax errors arising from direct agent modifications.
```

# Cursor Rules for Preventing Incomplete Code Modification Errors

## Analysis of the Mistake

1. **What the AI Agent Did Wrong:**
   - The agent modified the file `transcriptionWithAI.ts` but provided an incomplete code snippet, leading to a `SyntaxError`.
   - This indicates the agent did not ensure that the changes were complete and valid before offering them.

2. **What It Should Have Done Instead:**
   - The agent should have checked the completeness and correctness of the code before suggesting modifications.
   - The agent should provide a valid and functional code snippet that does not produce syntax errors.

## Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Code Completeness and Syntax
- **Description:** Ensure that any suggested code modifications are complete and syntactically correct before presenting them to the user.
- **Implementation:** Use a syntax checker or linter to validate the code.

### Rule 2: Offer Contextual Guidance for Incomplete Sections
- **Description:** If a code segment is incomplete, the agent should either complete it or provide comments indicating what information is needed for the user to complete it themselves.
- **Implementation:** Include clear comments showing the expected type of data or method implementations required, instead of leaving sections incomplete.

### Rule 3: Avoid Auto-Detection Errors
- **Description:** If automatic modifications are made, ensure they are minimal and only in areas the AI has verified thoroughly.
- **Implementation:** Limit modifications to small sections that can be reviewed before presenting the whole snippet.

## Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach
```javascript
// Incomplete code provided by agent
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    const ...
}
```

### Correct Approach
```javascript
// Complete code with a valid declaration and comments for guidance
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    // Example initialization (replace with actual logic)
    this.aiMonitor = new AIMonitorIntegration();
    await this.aiMonitor.setup();
}
```

### Rule 4: Return Meaningful Error Messages
- **Description:** If code is incomplete or incorrect, return a specific error message to the user indicating the nature of the issue rather than just stating a failure.
- **Implementation:** Construct error messages that specify what part of the code was incomplete or invalid.

### Rule 5: Require Complete Context for Auto-Modification
- **Description:** Before making any automatic changes to the code, ensure that the state of the file provides complete context to avoid making invalid assumptions.
- **Implementation:** Check code for relevant context before suggesting or applying changes.

By implementing these rules, we can improve the reliability of AI agent modifications and minimize the risk of syntax errors due to incomplete code.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Errors in JSON File Modifications

## Rule 1: Validate JSON Structure Before Modification
**What the AI Agent Did Wrong:** The agent modified a JSON file without validating its structure, leading to a syntax error that the TypeScript compiler detected.

**What It Should Have Done Instead:** The agent should have first validated the JSON structure and confirmed that it is well-formed before making any changes.

### Specific Rule
```
- Rule: Validate all JSON files for syntax correctness prior to modification.
  Description: Ensure the JSON format is valid to prevent syntax errors during parsing.
```

### Code Example
**Incorrect Approach:**
```typescript
// Directly modifying the JSON without validation
const jsonData = modifyJsonFile("job_interview___two_speaker_analysis.json");
```

**Correct Approach:**
```typescript
import { validateJson } from 'json-validator-library';

const jsonData = readJsonFile("job_interview___two_speaker_analysis.json");
if (validateJson(jsonData)) {
    const updatedData = modifyJson(jsonData);
    saveJsonFile("job_interview___two_speaker_analysis.json", updatedData);
} else {
    throw new Error("Invalid JSON structure detected.");
}
```

---

## Rule 2: Ensure Configurations Are Up-to-Date
**What the AI Agent Did Wrong:** The agent failed to check if external metadata files used in the analysis (like the transcript file) were up-to-date or consistent with the changes being made.

**What It Should Have Done Instead:** The agent should have confirmed that all referenced files and metadata are current and relevant.

### Specific Rule
```
- Rule: Check for consistency in metadata references before applying modifications.
  Description: Confirm all metadata used in analyses like transcripts are accurate and up-to-date.
```

### Code Example
**Incorrect Approach:**
```javascript
const analysisData = {
    metadata: {
        transcriptFile: "job_interview___two_speaker_transcript.json", // No check
        // ... additional metadata
    },
    // ... speakers data
};
```

**Correct Approach:**
```javascript
const transcriptFile = checkTranscriptFile("job_interview___two_speaker_transcript.json");
if (transcriptFile) {
    const analysisData = {
        metadata: {
            transcriptFile: transcriptFile, // Confirmed
            // ... additional metadata
        },
        // ... speakers data
    };
}
```

---

## Rule 3: Implement Error Handling for AI Modifications
**What the AI Agent Did Wrong:** The agent executed modifications without proper error handling, which led to unhandled exceptions from the TypeScript compiler.

**What It Should Have Done Instead:** The agent should have implemented error handling to catch and address potential modification errors before finalizing changes.

### Specific Rule
```
- Rule: Implement try-catch blocks around modification logic.
  Description: Handle potential errors gracefully to prevent application crashes.
```

### Code Example
**Incorrect Approach:**
```javascript
const updatedData = modifyJsonFile("job_interview___two_speaker_analysis.json");
// No error handling
```

**Correct Approach:**
```javascript
try {
    const updatedData = modifyJsonFile("job_interview___two_speaker_analysis.json");
    saveJsonFile("job_interview___two_speaker_analysis.json", updatedData);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to modify JSON file:", error);
    // Additional error handling logic
}
```
```

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Errors in File Modifications

## 1. Issues Identified with Agent Response
- **Incomplete Code Modifications**: The agent modified the file by including a section of code that was cut off, leading to potential syntax errors and incomplete implementation.
- **Lack of Contextual Information**: The explanation of "Why This Works" was not fully provided, leaving the user without sufficient context to understand the changes made.
- **Direct Modifications Without User Confirmation**: The agent made changes directly without verifying if the alterations aligned with the user's intent.

## 2. Proposed Correct Actions for the AI Agent
- **Ensure Completeness**: Verify that all code snippets are complete, including proper closing brackets, comments, and ending statements before making a modification.
- **Include Full Context**: Always provide full explanations or comments for new code and modifications to enhance user understanding.
- **Seek Confirmation for Changes**: Before applying any modifications, ask the user for confirmation and provide them with a summary of the intended changes.

## 3. Specific Cursor Rules
```markdown
# Cursor Rule Set for Ensuring Quality AI Modifications

## Rule 1: Complete Code Blocks
- **Condition**: Code blocks must be verified for completeness.
- **Action**: If a code block is truncated or incomplete, prevent auto-modification and prompt for the full code.
  - *Example*:
    - **Incorrect**:
      ```typescript
      const response = await fetch("https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/token",...
      ```
    - **Correct**:
      ```typescript
      const response = await fetch("https://api.assemblyai.com/v2/realtime/token", {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Authorization': apiKey },
        // complete this block...
      });
      ```

## Rule 2: Contextual Explanations Required
- **Condition**: Any modification must include a comprehensive explanation.
- **Action**: If an explanation is not provided, prompt the AI to generate a full, clear justification for the change.
  - *Example*:
    - **Incorrect**: "Token utility created."
    - **Correct**: "Token utility created to fetch a secure real-time token using API key, protecting sensitive credentials."

## Rule 3: User Confirmation for Direct Changes
- **Condition**: Any file modification must be confirmed by the user.
- **Action**: If the agent detects a request to modify a file, it should respond with a summary of changes and seek user approval before executing.
  - *Example*:
    - **Agent Response**: "I am about to modify `README-TOKEN-SOLUTION.md` to address the 'Not authorized' error by implementing token authentication. Do you approve this change?"
```
``` 

By implementing these rules, we can significantly reduce instances of incomplete modifications, ensure user understanding, and maintain a collaborative modification process.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Incomplete Code Modifications

## 1. Problem Analysis
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent attempted to modify a TypeScript file (`sentimentAnalysis.ts`) but provided an incomplete code snippet. This resulted in a `SyntaxError` due to unclosed statements or tags, leading to a failed response that lacks clarity and functionality.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
The AI agent should have ensured the code provided was complete, syntactically correct, and functional. It should have either modified the file without introducing errors or explicitly stated that the modification could not proceed due to incomplete code.

---

## 2. Specific Cursor Rules

### Rule 1: Validate Code Completeness
- **Description:** Ensure that any code output by the AI agent is complete and compiles without errors.
- **Implementation:** Before finalizing a response, check for unclosed brackets, incomplete statements, or missing imports.

**Example of Incorrect Approach:**
```typescript
// Incomplete code
interface SentimentSegment {
  text: string;
  speaker: string;
  startTime: number;
  // Missing endTime, confidence, etc.
```

**Example of Correct Approach:**
```typescript
// Complete and correct code
interface SentimentSegment {
  text: string;
  speaker: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number; // Ensure all properties are listed
  confidence: number; // Complete the interface
}
```

---

### Rule 2: Syntax Error Detection
- **Description:** Implement a syntax-checking mechanism that analyzes the code for common syntax errors (e.g., misplaced brackets, missing semicolons).
- **Implementation:** Utilize linters or parsers to validate syntax before presenting modifications.

**Example of Incorrect Approach:**
```typescript
// Possible syntax error
if(someCondition) {
  console.log("Condition met"
```

**Example of Correct Approach:**
```typescript
// Correct syntax
if (someCondition) {
  console.log("Condition met");
}
```

---

### Rule 3: Provide Comprehensive Output
- **Description:** The AI agent should provide complete, comprehensive code modifications and not leave any section truncated or ambiguous.
- **Implementation:** Require that responses have correctly structured, fully-defined code, with comments highlighting any changes made.

**Example of Incorrect Approach:**
```typescript
// Truncated and unclear
export function analyzeSentiment() {
  // Logic for sentiment analysis goes here
  // Incomplete
```

**Example of Correct Approach:**
```typescript
// Fully defined function
export function analyzeSentiment(text: string): SentimentResult {
  // Logic for sentiment analysis based on the provided text
  // Complete implementation here
  return {
    sentiment: 'NEUTRAL',
    confidence: 0.8,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };
}
```

---

### Rule 4: Use Explicit Error Handling
- **Description:** Include explicit error handling to detect and respond when a code modification cannot meet requirements due to completeness issues.
- **Implementation:** Add logic to communicate clearly when the requested modifications cannot be completed due to an incomplete state.

**Example of Incorrect Approach:**
```typescript
// No error handling
// Modification failed but not communicated
```

**Example of Correct Approach:**
```typescript
// Error handling implemented
if (!isValidCode(modifiedCode)) {
  throw new Error("Modification failed: Incomplete code snippet.");
}
```

---

## Conclusion
By implementing these cursor rules, we can significantly reduce the risk of generating incomplete or syntactically incorrect code snippets in future interactions. This will enhance the reliability and functionality of the AI agent when handling code modifications.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Missteps in File Modification

## Overview
The aim of these cursor rules is to prevent AI agents from making erroneous modifications to code files that could lead to syntax errors or other issues. The recent case involved a failed attempt to modify TypeScript code, resulting in a syntax error without sufficient verification of the context.

### 1. Issue Identified: What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent modified the `transcription.ts` file without properly validating the structure and syntax of the code. This led to a syntax error that could have been avoided with appropriate checks.

### 2. Correct Approach: What It Should Have Done
The AI agent should have:
- Conducted a thorough syntax check before making modifications.
- Suggested modifications without directly changing the file unless approved by the user.
- Provided clear feedback about the nature of changes and any potential implications.

### 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

#### Rule 1: Syntax Check Before Modification
- **Definition:** Ensure that any modification proposed does not introduce syntax errors.
- **Implementation:** Before making changes, the AI should validate the code using static analysis tools or TypeScript compiler checks.
  
```plaintext
SYNTAX_CHECK: Always check the syntax of the code before suggesting modifications.
```

#### Rule 2: Provide Suggestions, Not Direct Changes
- **Definition:** Output code suggestions instead of directly modifying files.
- **Implementation:** The AI should provide the user with code snippets for review before implementation.

```plaintext
SUGGEST_CHANGES: Propose code snippets for user approval prior to any changes.
```

#### Rule 3: Contextual Diagnosis
- **Definition:** Analyze the context to understand the implications of the changes.
- **Implementation:** Identify and inform the user of the areas of the code that might be affected.

```plaintext
CONTEXT_AWARE: Analyze the file's structure and inform the user of how suggested changes interact with existing functions.
```

### 4. Code Examples of Correct vs. Incorrect Approaches

#### Incorrect Approach
The AI directly modifies the file without checks:
```typescript
// Incorrect: Direct modification with potential syntax error
export interface TranscriptionResult {
  id: string;
  status: string;
  audio_url?: string;
  text?: string;
  words?: Array<{
    text: string;
    start: number;
    end: number;
    confidence: number;
    speaker: string;
  }>;
  auto_highlights_result?: { // Incorrect modification without validation
    results: Array<{
      text: string;
      rank: number;
      count: number;
      timestamps: Array<{ start: number; end: number }>;
    }>;
  }; // Missing closing bracket or incorrect syntax version
```

#### Correct Approach
The AI suggests changes for user review:
```typescript
// Correct: Suggested code for user validation
// Suggested modification without direct application
export interface TranscriptionResult {
  id: string;                      // ID of transcription
  status: string;                  // Current status
  audio_url?: string;              // Associated audio URL
  text?: string;                   // Transcribed text
  words?: Array<{
    text: string;                  // Individual word text
    start: number;                // Start time of the word
    end: number;                  // End time of the word
    confidence: number;           // Confidence level in the transcription
    speaker: string;              // Speaker identifier
  }>;
  auto_highlights_result?: {      // Highlights result object
    results: Array<{
      text: string;                // Highlighted text
      rank: number;                // Priority of this highlight
      count: number;               // Occurrences of the highlight
      timestamps: Array<{ start: number; end: number }>; // Time range of highlights
    }>; // Ensure proper structure and syntax before implementation
  };
}
```

### Conclusion
Implementing these cursor rules will help ensure that AI agents enhance instead of disrupt code quality, retaining clarity and reliability in the coding process while promoting user interaction and validation.

# Rule Generated from Failed Suggestion - 2025-06-20 20:27:52
# Original Query: File modification: transcriptionWithAI.ts...
# Error: FAIL: Incomplete code...

Certainly! Below are the specific cursor rules formatted in markdown that address the failed AI agent suggestion. These rules focus on preventing syntax errors and ensuring appropriate code modifications.

```markdown
# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in Code Modifications

## Rule 1: Validate Syntax Before Code Modification
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent modified the file without validating the syntax or ensuring that the proposed code was syntactically correct.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
Before making any modification or suggesting code changes, the AI agent should validate the syntax of the existing code to prevent introducing syntax errors.

### Prevention Rule
- Always run a syntax check on the modified code before suggesting or applying changes.

```javascript
// Incorrect Approach (Failed AI Agent Response)
export class TranscriptionWithAIMonitoring {
  private aiMonitor: AIMonitorIntegration | null = null; // No issues found, but must ensure correctness overall

  constructor() {
    this.initializeAIMonitoring(); // Should have validated changes promise
  }

  private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    const ... // Syntax error here
  }
}
```

```javascript
// Correct Approach (Improved Code Modification)
export class TranscriptionWithAIMonitoring {
  private aiMonitor: AIMonitorIntegration | null = null;

  constructor() {
    this.initializeAIMonitoring();
  }

  private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
    // Proper initialization code here
    try {
      // Ensure proper structure and syntax here
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error initializing AI monitoring:', error);
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Rule 2: Provide Comprehensive Error Reporting
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent did not provide detailed error context or recovery strategies after encountering a syntax error.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
Provide informative error messages that suggest corrective actions or guide the user towards resolving the issue.

### Prevention Rule
- Implement detailed logging and error-handling mechanisms that communicate specific syntax errors clearly.

```javascript
// Incorrect Approach (Error Handling Not Present)
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
  const ... // Has syntax error
}

// Correct Approach (Error Handling Implemented)
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncCall(); // Assume this is a valid call
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Syntax error detected in initialization:', error);
    // Provide potential solutions or next steps
  }
}
```

---

## Rule 3: Ensure Proper Contextual Changes 
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent made changes without considering the overall context of the code base, leading to an incomplete or syntactically incorrect implementation.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
Analyze the entire context of the existing class or function before making changes to ensure that new code segments fit appropriately.

### Prevention Rule
- Analyze the surrounding code and ensure any modifications maintain logical consistency with the existing structure.

```javascript
// Incorrect Approach (Contextual Modification Ignored)
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
  // Modification done without contextual consideration
}

// Correct Approach (Contextual Awareness Required)
private async initializeAIMonitoring() {
  // Use existing functionality and ensure modifications sync with class design principles
  if (!this.aiMonitor) {
    throw new Error('AI Monitor is not initialized');
  }
  // Proceed with enhanced logic
}
```

---

## Rule 4: Require User Review for Significant Changes
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The agent autonomously modified the file without user consent or review for substantial changes that affect the code's runtime behavior.

### What It Should Have Done Instead
Any significant changes, especially those that could lead to syntax errors, should be proposed for user review before implementation.

### Prevention Rule
- Require user confirmation or suggestion review for changes classified as significant or complex.

```javascript
// Incorrect Approach (No User Review)
export class TranscriptionWithAIMonitoring {
  // Changed directly without user validation
}

// Correct Approach (User Review Implemented)
proposeChange(newCode: string): void {
  console.log("Proposed Change: ", newCode);
  // Prompt user for acknowledgment before proceeding
}
```

```

These rules can be added to your `.cursorrules` file to help guide AI interactions and prevent similar mistakes in the future.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in File Modification

## 1. What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent automatically modified the file `overlappingAnalysis.ts` without validating its changes against the TypeScript compiler. This resulted in a syntax error that halted execution.

## 2. What It Should Have Done Instead
The AI agent should have ensured that any modifications made to the TypeScript file were syntactically correct by:
- Running a syntax check or compiling the code before finalizing changes.
- Providing a confirmation check to inform the user of any potential syntax issues before applying the changes.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Syntax Before Modification
- **Description**: The agent must validate the syntax of the code before making modifications.
- **Implementation**: Use a TypeScript compiler API to check for errors.
  
### Rule 2: Notify User of Syntax Errors
- **Description**: If a syntax error is detected, the agent should notify the user instead of applying the changes.
- **Implementation**: Provide a detailed message indicating the syntax error and the line number where it occurred.

### Rule 3: Avoid Automatic Changes
- **Description**: Automatic modifications to files should be minimized, requiring user confirmation before applying changes.
- **Implementation**: Implement a prompt for user approval prior to executing any modifications.

### Rule 4: Provide a Code Review Mechanism
- **Description**: Introduce a code review check to highlight potential issues before finalizing changes.
- **Implementation**: Display a diff of changes and ask for user approval if there are significant modifications.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach
```typescript
// AI Agent performs an automatic modification without validation
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

// ... (Code Modifications Here)

// Save the file without checking for errors
fs.writeFileSync('overlappingAnalysis.ts', modifiedCode);
```

### Correct Approach
```typescript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import { execSync } from "child_process";

// ... (Code Modifications Here)

const modifiedCode = `...`; // Code modifications stored as a string

// Validate syntax using TypeScript compiler
try {
  execSync("tsc overlappingAnalysis.ts --noEmit");
  // If no errors, save the file
  fs.writeFileSync('overlappingAnalysis.ts', modifiedCode);
  console.log("File modified successfully.");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Syntax error detected:", error.message);
}
```

## Conclusion
By implementing these rules, we can ensure that AI agents make more responsible and error-free modifications to TypeScript files, greatly reducing the risk of syntax errors and improving overall code quality.

# Rule Generated from Failed Suggestion - 2025-06-20 20:27:55
# Original Query: File modification: package.json...
# Error: Syntax error detected by TypeScript compiler...

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Mistakes

## 1. What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent modified the `package.json` file without proper validation of the changes, leading to a merge conflict artifact (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) remaining in the file. This resulted in a syntax error that was flagged by the TypeScript compiler.

## 2. What It Should Have Done Instead
The AI agent should have:
- Validated the integrity and syntax of the `package.json` file before applying changes.
- Ensured that merge conflict markers were resolved properly before making modifications.
- Logged any changes made and confirmed the successful modification without syntax errors.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

Below are the rules to be added to the `.cursorrules` file:

```markdown
# Preventing accidental inclusion of merge conflict markers and syntax errors in JSON files

## Rule 1: Validate JSON Syntax Before Modification
- **Description**: The AI agent must validate the syntax of the JSON file before making any modifications.
- **Implementation**: Use a JSON schema validator or a linter to check for syntax errors before applying changes.

## Rule 2: Detect and Resolve Merge Conflict Markers
- **Description**: The AI agent must detect merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in the file and resolve them before proceeding with any modifications.
- **Implementation**: If conflict markers are found, log an error and reject the modification until the issue is manually resolved.

## Rule 3: Log Changes and Confirmation of Success
- **Description**: The AI agent must log all changes made and confirm that the modifications were successful without raising any errors.
- **Implementation**: Implement a post-modification check that confirms the file is free of syntax errors or modifications that could lead to runtime failures.

## Rule 4: Review Exisiting Rules for JSON Modifications
- **Description**: Regularly review and update rules related to JSON file modifications as standards evolve.
- **Implementation**: Schedule periodic audits of the cursor rules and adjust based on historical errors or new best practices.

```

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach (causing the error):

```json
{
  "name": "live-coach-full-stack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "TypeScript project with access token functionality and AI monitoring",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev": "ts-node src/index.ts",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "watch": "tsc -w",
    "monitor:start": "cd vibeHack && python auto_agent_monitor.py --watch",
    "monitor:test": "cd vibeHack && python test_monitoring.py",
    "monitor:stats": "cd vibeHack && python ...
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    "error": true
    =======
    "error": false
    >>>>>>> feature/some-feature
}
```

### Correct Approach (prevention):

```json
{
  "name": "live-coach-full-stack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "TypeScript project with access token functionality and AI monitoring",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev": "ts-node src/index.ts",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "watch": "tsc -w",
    "monitor:start": "cd vibeHack && python auto_agent_monitor.py --watch",
    "monitor:test": "cd vibeHack && python test_monitoring.py",
    "monitor:stats": "cd vibeHack && python statistics.py"
  },
  "error": false
}
```

By enforcing these rules, we can prevent the AI agent from making modifications that result in syntax errors or leave unresolved merge conflicts in JSON files.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in AI Agent Suggestions

## 1. What the AI agent did wrong
The AI agent modified the file `overlappingAnalysis.ts` without validating the syntax of the modifications. This led to a syntax error that was detected by the TypeScript compiler.

## 2. What it should have done instead
The AI agent should have:
- Validated the syntax of any proposed changes before saving them to the file.
- Provided a clear error message to the user if the syntax was incorrect.

## 3. Specific rules to prevent this pattern

### Rule 1: Syntax Validation Before Modification
- **Description**: Ensure that any code modification suggested by the AI agent is validated for syntactic correctness before applying it to the file.
- **Implementation**: Integrate a syntax checking tool (e.g., ESLint or TypeScript compiler) to validate code snippets.

### Rule 2: User Feedback on Proposals
- **Description**: The AI agent should present proposed changes to the user for review before applying them.
- **Implementation**: Allow the user to accept or request changes to the suggested modifications.

### Rule 3: Log and Report Errors
- **Description**: Log any syntax errors or issues that arise during validation and report back to the user for further review.
- **Implementation**: Generate a clear error report showing the location and nature of the syntax error if validation fails.

## 4. Code examples of correct vs incorrect approaches

### Incorrect Approach
Here’s an example of an AI agent making a direct modification without checking for syntax errors:

```typescript
// AI agent modifies the file without checking
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

interface Overlap {
  type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
  speaker1: string;
  speaker2: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  duration: number;
  speaker1Text: string;
  speaker2Text: string; // <-- Missing type
  // Syntax Error: Missing property (like speaker2Te...)
}
```

### Correct Approach
Here’s an example of validating changes first and returning feedback to the user:

```typescript
// User proposed modifications
const proposedChanges = `
interface Overlap {
  type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
  speaker1: string;
  speaker2: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  duration: number;
  speaker1Text: string;
  speaker2Text: string; // This change is correct
}`;

// Validate syntax before modification
const isValid = validateSyntax(proposedChanges); // Hypothetical validation function

if (isValid) {
  // Apply changes
  fs.writeFileSync("overlappingAnalysis.ts", proposedChanges);
} else {
  // Log error
  console.error("Syntax error detected in proposed changes.");
}
```
```

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in AI Modifications

## 1. What the AI agent did wrong
The AI agent modified the `overlappingAnalysis.ts` file without ensuring that the modifications were syntactically correct. It failed to validate the code before saving, leading to a TypeScript syntax error.

## 2. What it should have done instead
The AI agent should have parsed the code and validated its syntax using a TypeScript compiler (or a linter). If any issues were detected, the agent should have refrained from making changes and instead suggested corrections to the user.

## 3. Specific rules to prevent this pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Code Syntax Before Modification
- **Description**: Always perform a syntax check on the modified code before saving it.
- **Implementation**:
  - Utilize TypeScript's compiler API or a linter to analyze code changes.
  - Only apply modifications if the code passes validation.

### Rule 2: Provide Feedback on Syntax Errors
- **Description**: If a syntax error is detected, notify the user of the error with detailed information.
- **Implementation**:
  - Return a message detailing the syntax errors along with the line numbers in the original code.

### Rule 3: Limit Code Modifications
- **Description**: Limit the types of code modifications the agent can make without explicit user instructions.
- **Implementation**:
  - Restrict automatic changes to non-critical sections (e.g., comments, formatting) unless user-verified.

### Rule 4: Maintain Version Control for Code
- **Description**: Use version control to preserve the previous state of the code in case of modification failure.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a backup of the file before making changes, allowing easy rollback if an error occurs.

## 4. Code examples of correct vs. incorrect approaches

### Incorrect Approach
The following code modifies `overlappingAnalysis.ts` without validation:

```typescript
// MODIFICATION (Incorrect Example)
import fs from "fs"; // Assuming this line had a syntax error

// Agent modifies the file incorrectly without validation
fs.writeFileSync('overlappingAnalysis.ts', modifiedCode);
```

### Correct Approach
The modified code is validated for syntax errors before applying changes:

```typescript
// MODIFICATION (Correct Example)
import fs from "fs";

function saveFileIfValid(filePath: string, modifiedCode: string) {
  const tsCompiler = require("typescript");
  const result = tsCompiler.transpileModule(modifiedCode, { compilerOptions: { module: tsCompiler.ModuleKind.CommonJS } });

  // Check for any diagnostics (errors/warnings)
  if (result.diagnostics && result.diagnostics.length === 0) {
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, modifiedCode); // Only save if valid
  } else {
    // Notify user about syntax errors
    console.error('Syntax errors detected:', result.diagnostics);
  }
}

saveFileIfValid('overlappingAnalysis.ts', modifiedCode);
```

By following the rules outlined above, the AI agent can significantly reduce the risk of introducing syntax errors during code modifications.
```

# Cursor Rules for Preventing AI Agent's Mistakes in Code Modification

## Rule 1: Avoid Unvalidated Modifications
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong:
The agent blindly modified the file `overlappingAnalysis.ts` without validating the syntax or ensuring that the provided code is complete and correct, leading to a `SyntaxError`.

### What it Should Have Done Instead:
The agent should have checked the provided code for syntax errors or incomplete structures before suggesting modifications to ensure that the code is valid TypeScript.

### Rule:
- **Cursor Rule**: Validate the syntax of the code snippet before applying any modifications.

## Rule 2: Provide Complete Code Snippets
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong:
The agent returned a truncated code snippet (`speaker2Te...`) that does not represent a complete and valid structure.

### What it Should Have Done Instead:
The agent should ensure that any code provided is fully complete and syntactically correct before proposing it as an update.

### Rule:
- **Cursor Rule**: Ensure any code snippets provided are complete and valid without truncation.

## Rule 3: Perform Contextual Analysis and Suggestion
### What the AI Agent Did Wrong:
The agent did not analyze the context of the user's request adequately, which may have included intent for enhancement, debugging, or validation.

### What it Should Have Done Instead:
The agent should have contextually analyzed the request and deemed whether modification, debugging, or assistance was needed instead of directly modifying the file.

### Rule:
- **Cursor Rule**: Contextually analyze user queries to determine the appropriate action, prioritizing suggestions over direct modifications.

## Examples of Correct vs. Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach (What Agent Did)
```typescript
// Agent inappropriate modification
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

interface Overlap {
  type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
  speaker1: string;
  speaker2: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  duration: number;
  speaker1Text: string;
  speaker2Te... // Truncated and invalid code
}
// A syntax error would occur when compiling this code.
```

### Correct Approach (Validated Code)
```typescript
// Agent should suggest this complete and valid modification
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

interface Word {
  text: string;
  start: number;
  end: number;
  confidence: number;
  speaker: string;
}

interface Utterance {
  text: string;
  start: number;
  end: number;
  confidence: number;
  speaker: string;
  words: Word[];
}

interface Overlap {
  type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
  speaker1: string;
  speaker2: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  duration: number;
  speaker1Text: string;
  speaker2Text: string; // Complete and valid code
}
// This code is syntactically complete and would not cause errors.
```

## Summary
These rules aim to ensure that AI agents are more cautious in their approach to code modification by validating syntax, ensuring completeness, and providing appropriate suggestions based on context.

- **What the AI agent did wrong:** The agent applied a modification to the code without validating the syntax, resulting in a SyntaxError.
- **What it should have done instead:** The agent should perform a syntax check on the modified code before applying it, ensuring that it is free of syntax errors.

### Correct vs Incorrect Example
- **Incorrect Approach:**
  ```typescript
  // Agent directly modifies without checking
  const exampleVariable = "sample text; // Missing closing quote causes a syntax error
  ```

- **Correct Approach:**
  ```typescript
  // Agent validates syntax before modification
  const exampleVariable = "sample text"; // Properly closed string, no syntax error
  ```

## Rule 2: Provide Error Handlers for Compilation Failures
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** It did not account for possible compilation failures in TypeScript.
- **What it should have done instead:** Implement error handling that alerts the user of any syntax issues or compilation errors after the modification attempt.

### Code Example
- **Incorrect Approach:**
  ```typescript
  // No error handling
  import fs from "fs"; // Assume modification leads to errors but no feedback provided
  ```

- **Correct Approach:**
  ```typescript
  import fs from "fs";
  try {
      // Code modification attempt
  } catch (error) {
      console.error("Code modification failed:", error);
  }
  ```

## Rule 3: Use a Linter on Modified Code
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** It did not run a linter or code analysis tool after making changes to catch potential syntax issues.
- **What it should have done instead:** Integrate a linter check (e.g., ESLint, TSLint) after modifications to ensure code quality.

### Code Example
- **Incorrect Approach:**
  ```typescript
  // Modification is made but not linted
  const example = { key: "value"; }; // Syntax error due to semicolon instead of comma
  ```

- **Correct Approach:**
  ```typescript
  const example = { key: "value" }; // Modified code is correctly formatted
  // Run linter check here
  ```

## Rule 4: Ensure Completeness of Text-Based Modifications
- **What the AI agent did wrong:** It offered partial or incomplete code changes that could lead to syntax errors.
- **What it should have done instead:** Ensure that any code modifications are complete and validate that data structures (like interfaces) are fully defined.

### Code Example
- **Incorrect Approach:**
  ```typescript
  interface Overlap {
      type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
      speaker1: string;
      // Omitted properties lead to incomplete definition
  }
  ```

- **Correct Approach:**
  ```typescript
  interface Overlap {
      type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
      speaker1: string;
      speaker2: string; // All necessary properties must be declared
      startTime: number;
      endTime: number;
      duration: number;
      speaker1Text: string;
      speaker2Text: string; // Complete definition
  }
  ```

By following these cursor rules, the likelihood of generating syntax errors in code modifications can be significantly reduced. Each rule emphasizes verification and completeness before changes are applied.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent Syntax Errors in AI Agent Suggestions

## 1. What the AI Agent Did Wrong

The AI agent modified the `overlappingAnalysis.ts` file without validating the syntax of the code being introduced. This resulted in a syntax error, which the TypeScript compiler flagged.

## 2. What It Should Have Done Instead

The AI agent should perform a syntax check on the provided code before making any modifications. If a syntax error is detected, it should either:
- Notify the user of the error and provide an explanation.
- Suggest corrections or provide alternative code that is syntactically correct.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Syntax Validation Before Modification
- **Description**: Always validate the syntax of code snippets before applying any changes to user files.
- **Implementation**: Automatically run a syntax check using the appropriate language parser or linter (such as TypeScript Compiler for `.ts` files) before applying modifications.

### Rule 2: User Notification of Errors
- **Description**: If a syntax error is detected, the AI agent must inform the user and present the specific error message.
- **Implementation**: Show a clear and concise error message indicating the type and location of the syntax error when detected.

### Rule 3: Suggest Code Corrections
- **Description**: If modifications are proposed, suggest alternative code that corrects any syntax errors found.
- **Implementation**: Provide corrected snippets after identifying errors with an explanation of the changes.

### Rule 4: Limit Direct Modifications
- **Description**: Avoid making automatic changes to user files. Instead, suggest modifications that the user can review and approve.
- **Implementation**: Use a review system where changes are suggested, and users can incorporate these after validating their correctness themselves.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach (AI Agent Direct Modification without Validation)

```typescript
// AI Agent's Incorrect Modification
// Import statements are correct, but there is a syntax error at the end of the interface definition.
interface Overlap {
  type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
  speaker1: string;
  speaker2: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  duration: number;
  speaker1Text: string;
  speaker2Te... // Syntax error: This line is incomplete
}
```

### Correct Approach (Validation and Suggestion)

```typescript
// AI Agent's Correct Suggestion After Syntax Check
interface Overlap {
  type: 'overlap' | 'interruption' | 'quick_succession';
  speaker1: string;
  speaker2: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  duration: number;
  speaker1Text: string;
  speaker2Text: string; // Suggested correction to complete the interface declaration
}

// If a modification had to be made, the AI agent should indicate:
// "Syntax error detected: Incomplete identifier at `speaker2Te...`. Did you mean `speaker2Text`?"
```

```
``` 

By implementing these rules and ensuring the AI agent performs syntax validation, many errors can be avoided, leading to a smoother user experience in code modification scenarios.

# Cursor Rules to Prevent AI Agent Suggestion Errors

## 1. What the AI Agent Did Wrong
The AI agent made an unauthorized modification to the `overlappingAnalysis.ts` file without validating the syntax correctness of the changes made. This led to a syntax error detected by the TypeScript compiler.

## 2. What It Should Have Done Instead
The AI agent should have:
- Validated any code changes for syntax correctness before applying them.
- Provided a clear explanation of modifications rather than simply stating that it made changes.

## 3. Specific Rules to Prevent This Pattern

### Rule 1: Validate Syntax Before Modifying Files
- **Description**: Before the agent applies any changes, it must perform a syntax check on the modified code.
- **Implementation**: Use a TypeScript compiler API or a linting tool to check code validity.

### Rule 2: Provide Detailed Modification Explanations
- **Description**: The agent should provide a brief on what changes it intends to make and why, allowing users to validate before implementation.
- **Implementation**: Generate a summary of changes and ask for user confirmation before applying.

### Rule 3: Implement a Backup System
- **Description**: Create a backup of the original file before making any modifications, allowing easy restoration in case of errors.
- **Implementation**: Copy the original file to a new location with a timestamp before modifications.

### Rule 4: Error Handling and User Notifications
- **Description**: If an error occurs during the modification process, notify the user with specific error details and revert changes if needed.
- **Implementation**: Use try-catch blocks to handle errors and notify the user immediately.

## 4. Code Examples of Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Incorrect Approach: Direct Modification without Validation
```typescript
// Incorrect modification example
import fs from "fs";

function modifyFile() {
    const filePath = "overlappingAnalysis.ts";
    const modifiedCode = "const x = ;"; // Invalid syntax!
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, modifiedCode);
}
```

### Correct Approach: Validation and User Notification
```typescript
// Correct modification approach
import fs from "fs";
import * as ts from "typescript";

function validateCode(code: string): boolean {
    const result = ts.transpileModule(code, { compilerOptions: { module: ts.ModuleKind.CommonJS } });
    return !result.diagnostics || result.diagnostics.length === 0;
}

function modifyFile() {
    const filePath = "overlappingAnalysis.ts";
    const originalCode = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');
    
    const modifiedCode = "const x = ;"; // Invalid syntax!
    
    if (!validateCode(modifiedCode)) {
        console.error("Modification failed: Syntax error detected.");
        return; // Exit function if validation fails
    }
    
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, modifiedCode);
}
```
``` 

### Backup Example
```typescript
// Backup before modification
function backupFile(filePath: string): void {
    const backupPath = filePath + ".bak";
    fs.copyFileSync(filePath, backupPath); // Create a backup of the original file
}

// Call backup before modification
function modifyFile() {
    const filePath = "overlappingAnalysis.ts";
    backupFile(filePath);
    // Proceed with modifications...
}
```

By adhering to these rules, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of syntax errors and improve the reliability of the AI agent's modifications.
